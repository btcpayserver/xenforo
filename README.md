You can use this integration wherever payment goes through XenForo payment profiles.

In most cases, a newly created payment profile requires activation in certain contexts.
Let's look at an example of activating a newly created profile for user upgrades:

1. Go to XenForo Admin Panel (/admin.php)
2. Click on [Setup] -> [Users] -> [User upgrades]
3. Click on the user upgrade you want to activate the payment profile for
4. Select the payment profile you created in the "Payment profile" select box
5. Click on [Save]
